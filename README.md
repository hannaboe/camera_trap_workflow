# A semi-automatic workflow to process camera trap images in R

This repository contains all scripts needed to run the semi-automatic workflow to process camera trap images described in Böhner et al. (2022). It also contains some example images to test the workflow. The small mammal classification model is available on https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7142734 
and will be downloaded automatically when running the workflow. 

Clone the repository or download it as a zip-file to run the workflow. Step by step instructions to follow the workflow are provided in the file `processing_camera_trap_images_step_by_step.pdf`.

The images used for training the small mammal classification-model are available on https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7142734 .
